# Readme Agent



The Readme_Agent is an AI-powered tool designed to automatically generate comprehensive README.md files for GitHub projects. It aims to help users create excellent documentation by interactively building the README section by section. The agent analyzes the repository, understands its structure and dependencies, and uses this information to generate relevant content.

**Please Note:** This project is currently under active development. While functional, it may contain bugs or incomplete features.

Key features include:

*   Automated analysis of GitHub repositories.
*   Generation of README sections based on repository content.
*   Interactive building of the README through user feedback.

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/B4K2/Readme_Agent.git
    cd Readme_Agent
    ```

2.  **Set up a virtual environment (recommended):**

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
    venv\Scripts\activate.bat  # On Windows
    ```

3.  **Install the dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Set up the environment variables:**

    *   Create a `.env` file in the project root.
    *   Add your Gemini API key to the `.env` file:

        ```
        GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
        ```

    **Note:** You will need a Gemini API key to use this project. You can obtain one from [[Gemini API](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey)].

## Usage

1.  **Run the `agent.py` file:**

    ```bash
    python multi_tool_agent/agent.py
    ```

2.  **Interact with the agent:**

    The agent will guide you through the process of generating the README file. It will ask you questions about the project and generate different sections based on your input.

    **Note:** Since this project is still in prototype, running instructions might be very basic. Detailed usage instructions will be added later.
